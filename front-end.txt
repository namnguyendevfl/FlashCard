1. JSX
- HTML like syntax
- defines an UI element right inside your React code
- is an expression => can save it in a variable
- embeded JS code inside JSX by using curly braces
- use () to enable all of these elements to take up multiple lines within this element
- add attributes much like you can in HTML
- store attribules in variable and embed it into JSX
- only have a single top-level JSX element
- need to use a fragment for multiple top-level JSX elements

2. Single-responsibility principle
- each module, function, or component in a program should have responsibility for one single part of the program

3. component
- single part of UI
- can be reused in multiple places
- made up of elements, with specific properties for your application
- each component should have one thing that it does following single-responsi. principle

4. Export
- default
    + a file has a single Export
    + one of the exports will be used more often than others
- you can have 1 default export and any number of named exports 

5. State
- is owned, and updated by the component
- refers to data affects how an app behaves and is rendered

6. Props: passed in a component from the parent component

7. Functional component
